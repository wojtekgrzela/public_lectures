Class work is realized in Python 3, in order to be able to work smoothly it is required (or at least strongly recommended) to install [Anaconda 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and to ensure that you have up to date versions of following packages:

- [PyStan](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - installation requires bit of work
- [Arviz](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)
- [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
- [SciPy](scipy)

For editing Stan code any text editor will be ok, syntax coloring is offered among the others by [Atom](https://atom.io).

It is strongly recommended to have a GitHub account and store your coursework in a repository (public or private).
