## Laboratory class requirements

It is recommended to use your own laptop computers.

Class work is realized in Python 3, in order to be able to work smoothly it is required (or at least strongly recommended) to install [Anaconda 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and to ensure that you have up to date versions of following packages:

- [PyStan](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - installation requires bit of work
- [Arviz](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)
- [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
- [SciPy](scipy)

For editing Stan code any text editor will be ok, syntax coloring is offered among the others by [Atom](https://atom.io).

It is strongly recommended to have a GitHub account and store your coursework in a repository (public or private).
